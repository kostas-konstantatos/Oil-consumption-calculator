This oil consumption calculator can be used by maximum five apartments. It weights the heating calories of each apartment,
the hours of the counters and also takes into consideration the residual oil (and its price) that is in the oil tank before
we put in the new order. It saves the data of each apartment in a .txt file ready to be printed if needed. You can easily
download and install the program and its attached files in your computer.
